# Quick Overview

## Column 1

### Outline
This course introduces all the essential ingredients needed to start Bayesian estimation and inference. We discuss specifying priors, obtaining the posterior, prior/posterior predictive checking, sensitivity analyses, and the usefulness of a specific class of priors called shrinkage priors. We propose strategies for reproducibility and reporting standards, outlining the WAMBS-checklist (when to Worry and how to Avoid the Misuse of Bayesian Statistics). We have prepared many exercises to enable students to get hands-on experience.

The popularity of Bayesian statistics has increased over the years; however, Bayesian methods are not a part of the statistics curricula in most graduate programs internationally. The Bayesian framework can handle some commonly encountered problems in classical statistics, such as the lack of power in small sample research and convergence issues in complex models. Furthermore, some researchers prefer the Bayesian framework because it sequentially updates knowledge with new data instead of requiring that each new study tests the null hypothesis that there is no effect in the population. The main focus of the course is on conceptually understanding Bayesian inference and applying Bayesian methods.

The instructors will clarify the differences between the philosophies and interpretations in classical and Bayesian frameworks. They illustrate how types of research questions can be answered using Bayesian methods. This course will also give students experience running Bayesian analyses and interpreting results and instruct participants on the prevailing “best practices” for writing a scientific article based on Bayesian statistics. Participants will emerge from the course with knowledge about how to apply Bayesian methods to answer their research questions and with the ability to understand articles that examine and use Bayesian methods.

# How to prepare

## Column 1

### Preparing for the course

We have prepared many exercises in `R`. If you are not familiar with R, we recommend following the installation instructions and working through the exercises below before the start of the course. 

**1. Install the latest version of `R`**
`R` can be obtained <a href="https://cran.r-project.org" target="_blank">here</a>. We won't use `R` directly in the course, but rather call `R` through `RStudio`. Therefore it needs to be installed. 

**2. Install the latest `RStudio` Desktop**

Rstudio is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE). It can be obtained as stand-alone software <a href="https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/#download" target="_blank">here</a>. The free and open source `RStudio Desktop` version is sufficient.

**3. Make sure you have a C++ compiler**

We will use several packages, but mostly `brms`. As explained <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/brms/readme/README.html" target="_blank">here</a>: *Because brms is based on Stan, a C++ compiler is required. The program* `Rtools` *(available* <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/" target="_blank">here</a> *comes with a C++ compiler for Windows. On Mac, you should install* `Xcode`. *For further instructions on how to get the compilers running, see the prerequisites section * <a href="https://github.com/stan-dev/rstan/wiki/RStan-Getting-Started" target="_blank">here</a>. 

### Materials

**Exercise ‘Intro R’**

If you're not familiar with R, you might want to work on these two exercises first before continuing:

The first is a basic intro to R. By following the steps outlined in this tutorial, you will establish a fundamental understanding of R. For this exercise click <a href="https://www.rensvandeschoot.com/tutorials/r-for-beginners/" target="_blank">here</a>.

The second exercise guides you through frequentist regression analysis in R, building upon your foundational knowledge. For this exercise, click <a href="https://www.rensvandeschoot.com/tutorials/linear-regression-in-r-frequentist/" target="_blank">here</a>.

The underlying code is available on <a href="https://github.com/Rensvandeschoot/Tutorials" target="_blank">GitHub</a>. Your feedback (via an issue or PR) to the code or the exercises is very much appreciated!

# Monday

## Column 1


### Outline
Day 1: we discuss the stages involved in Bayesian analysis: obtaining background knowledge from previous literature, specifying the prior distributions,  and deriving the posterior. We discuss the importance of prior and posterior predictive checking, and selecting a proper technique for sampling from a probability distribution. We prepared exercises in web apps to play around with priors and data to learn how these will affect the posterior.


### Materials
We adapt the course as we go. To ensure that you work with the latest iteration of the course materials, we advice all course participants to access the materials online.

**Exercise ‘First Bayesian Inference'**

The first exercise makes use of a Shiny App that is designed to ease its users’ first contact with Bayesian statistical inference. By "pointing and clicking", the user can analyze the IQ example as has been used in the easy-to-go introduction to Bayesian inference of van de Schoot et al. (2014).

For the exercise click <a href="content/monday/First-Bayesian-Inference-Exercise.html" target="_blank">here</a>.
To get to the Shiny App click <a href="https://utrecht-university.shinyapps.io/bayesian_estimation/" target="_blank">here</a>.

The underlying code is available on <a href="https://github.com/Rensvandeschoot/First-Bayesian-Inference" target="_blank">GitHub</a>. If you like the App, leave a star. Feedback (via an issue or PR) to the code or the exercise is very much appreciated!

**Exercise ‘Plausible Parameter Space’**

The Plausible Parameter Space (PPS) Shiny App is designed to help users define their priors in a linear regression with two regression coefficients. Users are asked to specify their plausible parameter space and their expected prior means and uncertainty around these means. The PhD-delay data is used as an easy-to-go introduction

# Tuesday

## Column 1

### Outline
Day 2: we discuss reproducibility and reporting standards strategies, outlining the WAMBS-checklist (when to Worry and how to Avoid the Misuse of Bayesian Statistics).  We have prepared exercises in R (brms) to get hands-on experience. If you are not familiar with R, we will send you some exercises to be completed before starting the course.

### Materials
We adapt the course as we go. To ensure that you work with the latest iteration of the course materials, we advice all course participants to access the materials online.

Note that the exercise requires a working version of the BRMS packages. See the `How to prepare` page if you do not have this yet.

The first exercise goes through the When-to-Worry-and-How-to-Avoid-the-Misuse-of-Bayesian-Statistics (WAMBS) – checklist for a simple regression model. Then follows a 3 part series on how to do multilevel models in BRMS. In part 1 we explain how to build a multilevel model. In part 2 we will look at the influence of different priors and in part 3 we will go through the WAMBS checklist again. 

**Exercise ‘WAMBS'**

This exercise leverages the power of the BRMS package in R to help users create Bayesian models and check them using the WAMBS – checklist.

# Wednesday

## Column 1

### Outline
Day 3: we discuss estimation methods including alternatives that can be more efficient when dealing with computational or non-covergence issues. A brief introduction to and  the benefits of these estimation methods (MCMC, Gibbs, MH, HMC, NUTS, etc.) will be reviewed. These insights can help to understand differences between software that can be used. Additionally, we will go into prior and posterior predictive checking. These are great tools to help understand what your models and priors are implying. Today may be a little more technical (less gentle) but without equations.

# Thursday

## Column 1


### Outline
Day 4: although the prior distribution can offer many advantages, the prior can also inadvertently influence the results. Today we will discuss the importance of prior sensitivity analysis to investigate the influence the prior has on the results. We will focus on models with many parameters to estimate, possibly too many for the model to be identified in a classical sense. We discuss the use of shrinkage priors to estimate these models and select substantial parameters.
